# What is UnityX?

**UnityX** is a built-from-scratch (meaning no code forked from Unity 7) desktop environment aiming to achieve the same goals that UnityX 10 attempted to achieve.

For visual reference on how the desktop environment may look as a finished project, see Canonical's Unity 8 concepts.
